### project information

This is a Text-based RPG, that works fully inside the terminal using Googles Gen AI Api;

The entire premise is to have infinite content via the use of AI; so all backstories and lore is randomly generated. 

For example; if your character is a character from a show or a movie; or anything custom made, then the backstory, lore and abilities are all generated related to that character.

- Practical Example

Lets say you made a character named saul goodman, the lawyer from breaking bad.
The AI generates the backstory; lets say that your character is in albequerque, new mexico, along with the profesion and backstory, like lawyer and everytihng else; along with custom, special made abilities like: Persuasion and Negotiation; or legal loophole exploitation. And the entire world map generates according to that. 

```
you may check the world map in the world.json file in the folder you have selected
```
