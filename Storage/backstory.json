    "backstory": "Delhi, a city steeped in history and legend, has been a crossroads of empires for millennia. From the majestic Mughal emperors to the British Raj, its streets whisper tales of power, intrigue, and resilience. Beneath the surface of modern Delhi, where gleaming skyscrapers rise alongside ancient ruins, a network of hidden societies and forgotten magic persists. The descendants of powerful sorcerers, banished to the shadows centuries ago, still practice their craft, concealed from the everyday world. Shreyansh, unknowingly, is a part of this lineage. His ancestors, healers renowned for their knowledge of herbs and forgotten remedies, were forced into hiding during a purge of magical practitioners. Their secrets, diluted and forgotten by most, lie dormant within Shreyansh, waiting to be awakened.",
    "location": "Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi. This bustling marketplace, a chaotic symphony of sights, sounds, and smells, is Shreyansh's world. The narrow, labyrinthine streets, overflowing with merchants, hawkers, and the aroma of spices, are both his home and his livelihood. The sheer density of people provides a perfect camouflage for those who wish to remain unnoticed, and its ancient history makes it a hotbed for mystical energies. The dilapidated havelis (mansions) that line the alleys hold secrets of the past, whispering to those who know how to listen.",
