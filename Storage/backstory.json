  "backstory": "The world of Aerthos was forged in the celestial crucible of twin suns, Sol and Luna. For millennia, the five Elder Races - the Sylvani of the Whispering Woods, the Aquari of the Sunken Cities, the Terrai of the Stone Peaks, the Ignis of the Ember Wastes, and the Aeri of the Sky Citadels - lived in relative harmony, governed by the Concordant Council, an assembly of their wisest leaders. But harmony shattered five centuries ago with the emergence of the Voidbringers, beings of pure entropy from beyond the veil of reality. They sought to extinguish the light of Sol and Luna, plunging Aerthos into eternal darkness. A great war erupted, leaving scars upon the land and decimating entire civilizations. The Concordant Council fractured, unable to agree on a unified strategy. Ultimately, it was a coalition of unlikely heroes, each wielding a fragment of the Shattered Star - a celestial artifact capable of repelling the Voidbringers - that pushed them back into the abyss. However, the victory was pyrrhic. The Shattered Star fragments were scattered, the Elder Races retreated into isolation, and the Voidbringers remain a looming threat, their influence subtly corrupting the land and its inhabitants. The legacy of the war is etched into Aerthos's very soul, a constant reminder of the fragility of existence and the importance of unity.",
