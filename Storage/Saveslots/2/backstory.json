    "backstory": "Delhi, a city steeped in millennia of history, has always been a melting pot of empires and cultures. From the ancient Indraprastha mentioned in the Mahabharata to the Mughal grandeur of Shahjahanabad, its streets whisper tales of conquest, resilience, and transformation. Beneath the modern metropolis lies a hidden layer, a network of ancient wells, forgotten shrines, and crumbling ruins that hint at a deeper, more mystical past. For generations, certain families, including Shreyansh's ancestors, have been the silent guardians of these forgotten places, tasked with protecting them from those who would exploit their power or desecrate their history. Shreyansh's family, traditionally scholars and historians, have passed down the stories and secrets of Delhi's hidden history. But as the city continues to expand and modernize, these sacred sites are increasingly threatened by unchecked development and the relentless march of progress. Shreyansh's grandfather, a renowned historian of Delhi, always warned him about the danger of the forgotten places falling into the wrong hands and entrusted him with a special amulet that he believed would aid Shreyansh in the future.",
