    "backstory": "For centuries, the remote Himalayan peaks have been home to hermits, mystics, and those seeking solace from the world below. The treacherous terrain and biting winds weed out the weak, leaving only the truly dedicated or the desperate. Legends whisper of hidden valleys blessed with ancient energies, guarded by mythical creatures and forgotten deities. A lineage of explorers, driven by both scientific curiosity and spiritual yearning, has cautiously charted these regions, passing down their knowledge through generations. Among them, the Sherpa people possess an unparalleled understanding of the mountains, their culture intricately woven with the rhythms of the land. But with the dawn of the modern age, outsiders, lured by the prospect of untouched resources and the allure of undiscovered treasures, are beginning to encroach upon this sacred domain, disrupting the delicate balance of the mountains.",
