    "backstory": "Delhi, a city steeped in history and legend, has been a melting pot of cultures for centuries. From the ancient empires to the modern republic, its streets have witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, the clash of civilizations, and the quiet struggles of everyday life. Beneath the bustling markets and towering monuments, a network of forgotten pathways and hidden enclaves whispers tales of djinn and forgotten gods. Shreyansh's family, like many in Delhi, has roots stretching back generations, their ancestors having arrived during the Mughal era as skilled artisans. They settled in the Old Delhi area, mastering the art of Zardozi embroidery, a craft passed down through the family. However, with the rise of industrial production, their traditional craft struggled to survive. Shreyansh's grandfather, a master craftsman, tried to maintain the tradition, but the changing times eventually forced his father to seek work in the burgeoning IT sector, leading them to move out of Old Delhi but maintaining a connection through his grandparents.",
    "location": "A small, slightly dilapidated apartment in Dwarka, Delhi. It's a modern, middle-class area, a stark contrast to the historical grandeur of Old Delhi where Shreyansh's grandparents still reside. The apartment is functional but lacks character, reflecting his family's struggle to adapt to the demands of modern life. The balcony overlooks a crowded marketplace, a constant reminder of the city's relentless energy and Shreyansh's own feeling of being disconnected from the traditions of his ancestors.",
