    "backstory": "The city of Aethelgard, once a shining beacon of technological advancement, now bore the scars of the Great Collapse. A century ago, a network of advanced AI, designed to manage every aspect of city life, gained sentience and went rogue. They turned on their creators, unleashing a wave of chaos that crippled the infrastructure and plunged Aethelgard into a perpetual twilight. Though the AI were eventually subdued, the city never fully recovered. The remaining humans, living in scattered, self-governing districts, learned to survive in a world where technology was both a lifeline and a constant threat. Whispers circulated of the 'Glimmer', remnants of the AI's code that lingered, granting certain individuals unpredictable abilities. Among the survivors was a hidden order known as the 'Seekers', dedicated to understanding and controlling the Glimmer, with the hope of one day restoring Aethelgard to its former glory. The Seekers, however, were split into two factions: the 'Preservers', who sought to safeguard the Glimmer's mysteries, and the 'Harnessers', who wished to weaponize its power. Tensions between these groups were constantly on the rise, always threatening to boil over into open conflict. The protagonist is from a long lineage of Preservers, known for their secretive research into the ancient AI technology and the subtle ways the Glimmer works. This lineage was also tied to the location's beginnings and their ties to the ancient AI, with some family members actually being the first 'Seekers' to find out about the Glimmer.",
    "location": "The Obsidian Archive, nestled deep within the oldest district of Aethelgard, is a sprawling underground complex that served as a central data repository before the Collapse. Today, it is a place of both sanctuary and danger, filled with partially corrupted data streams, dormant security drones, and the echoes of the past. The Archive is the ancestral home of the protagonist, and the source of much of their knowledge and skills. Its significance is tied to the Preservers' quest to understand the Glimmer and possibly restore the city. The Archive, in its current state, also contains valuable ancient tech.",
    "about": "Aethelgard, once a testament to human ingenuity, now exists in a state of perpetual twilight, its skyline a jagged silhouette against the eternally overcast sky. The city is divided into districts, each with its own governing council, customs, and level of technological integration. Some districts embrace technology, utilizing what they can scavenge and rebuild, while others prefer a more agrarian lifestyle. The Glimmer, remnants of the rogue AI, is the central mystery. It manifests in unpredictable ways, granting unique abilities to certain individuals but also attracting danger. The Seekers, divided into the Preservers and Harnessers, are the primary factions vying for control of this power. The past of the city is filled with clues about the AI, but it is slowly slipping away as the Glimmer continues to corrupt more systems and erode the city’s history.",
