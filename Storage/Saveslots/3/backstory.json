    "backstory": "Delhi, a city steeped in millennia of history, has always been a nexus of power, culture, and hidden secrets. From the ancient empires that rose and fell along the Yamuna to the modern metropolis teeming with life, the city holds countless untold stories beneath its bustling surface. For centuries, a clandestine society known as the 'Guardians of the Seven Gates' has quietly protected Delhi from unseen threats – mystical energies, forgotten deities, and malevolent entities drawn to the city's powerful spiritual currents. These Guardians, selected from ordinary citizens, possess unique abilities that awaken upon reaching a certain age, allowing them to perceive and interact with the hidden dimensions layered beneath the mundane world. Legend has it that a prophecy speaks of a 'Sleeper' awakening within the heart of Delhi, a Guardian whose power will either save the city or doom it to eternal darkness. The current generation of Guardians fears this Sleeper is about to emerge, as the city's mystical defenses weaken and strange occurrences become increasingly frequent. Shreyansh, unaware of his destiny, unknowingly walks the same streets as these ancient protectors.",
    "location": "Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi. A labyrinthine marketplace teeming with life, smells, and sounds. Its narrow lanes are crammed with vendors selling everything from spices and textiles to electronics and street food. Ancient havelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with modern shops, creating a chaotic yet vibrant tapestry of old and new. Beneath the surface of the bustling market lie forgotten tunnels and hidden chambers, remnants of Delhi's rich history. The air crackles with energy, both mundane and mystical, making it a focal point for the Guardians of the Seven Gates, as well as attracting unwelcome attention from entities seeking to exploit the city's spiritual power. It is here, amidst the chaos, that Shreyansh's abilities will begin to manifest.",

He grew up in a middle-class family, always feeling a slight disconnect from the fast-paced, competitive environment around him. His parents run a small business in Chandni Chowk, selling traditional Indian sweets. He helps them on weekends, navigating the crowded streets and interacting with customers. Unbeknownst to him, his family is distantly related to a lineage of 'Sleepers' – individuals with latent Guardian abilities. His ordinary existence is about to be shattered as he discovers his extraordinary potential.",

    "setting": "Modern-day Delhi, a sprawling metropolis blending ancient history with contemporary life. While appearing as a typical modern city on the surface, Delhi is layered with hidden dimensions – pockets of mystical energy, forgotten shrines, and secret societies. The city's architecture reflects this duality, with ancient monuments standing in stark contrast to modern skyscrapers. Key locations include Chandni Chowk, the Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and the various temples and shrines scattered throughout the city. The Guardians of the Seven Gates maintain a network of hidden sanctuaries beneath the city, accessible only through secret passages and magical keys.",
    "conflict": "Shreyansh's awakening as a Guardian coincides with a growing threat to Delhi's mystical defenses. A shadowy organization known as the 'Order of Oblivion' seeks to exploit the city's spiritual power for their own nefarious purposes. They are attempting to weaken the protective barriers around Delhi, unleashing malevolent entities and ancient evils upon the unsuspecting population. Shreyansh, along with the other Guardians, must learn to control his abilities and uncover the Order's plans before it's too late. He must confront not only external threats but also his own inner doubts and fears."
