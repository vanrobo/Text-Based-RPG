    "backstory": "The year is 2042. The world has changed, though most don't realize the shift is more than technological. For centuries, a hidden society, known as the Lumin, has watched over humanity, subtly influencing events from the shadows. Their power source: the 'Aetherium,' a substance drawn from the planet's ley lines, capable of incredible feats of energy manipulation. They live in a secret network of interconnected enclaves across the globe, hidden from the mundane world. Amelia, a young woman with a seemingly ordinary life in Neo-Tokyo, is about to discover her connection to this hidden world. Born into a lineage of 'Aether Weavers,' capable of manipulating the Aetherium, she was shielded from her true heritage until now. The Lumin's enemies, the 'Umbra,' a faction seeking to weaponize the Aetherium for their own destructive purposes, are making their move. Amelia's grandmother, a respected Aether Weaver, disappeared mysteriously, leaving behind only a cryptic message hinting at Amelia's destiny. The Umbra’s influence is growing, and the very fabric of the Aetherium, and therefore the world, is at risk. Amelia's journey begins as a search for answers about her family and herself, which quickly becomes a desperate race to protect the world from the Umbra.",
    "location": "Neo-Tokyo, Japan. The bustling metropolis of Neo-Tokyo is a city of vibrant lights and towering skyscrapers, built atop ancient foundations. Underneath the neon-drenched streets and bustling markets, lie hidden pathways and ancient structures, forgotten remnants of the Lumin's influence. The city is a key nexus point for the Aetherium and thus, a hotbed for Umbra activity. The protagonist’s apartment, located in the vibrant Shinjuku district, is not only her home but the starting point to the Lumin enclaves in Neo-Tokyo.",
    "about": "In this world, reality is more complex than it seems. Humanity is unaware of the delicate balance between the Lumin and the Umbra, a battle fought in the shadows for control of the Aetherium. The Lumin, protectors of the balance, draw energy from the ley lines and use it to safeguard the world. The Umbra, driven by a lust for power, seeks to exploit the Aetherium for destruction. Their actions are often subtle, hidden beneath the guise of corporate espionage and social manipulation. The cultures of the world, while appearing normal on the surface, are unknowingly influenced by the actions of these factions. The protagonist’s understanding of this lore slowly unfolds as she uncovers her family's history.",
