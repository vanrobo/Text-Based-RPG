    "backstory": "The year is 2077. The world, once teeming with life, now struggles under the weight of ecological collapse. Mega-corporations have seized control, their gleaming towers piercing the toxic smog that blankets the cities. Hidden within the underbelly of Neo-Kyoto, a city built upon the ruins of the old, exists the 'Whisper Network,' a clandestine group of hackers and activists. They fight against the corporate overlords, using their technological prowess to expose corruption and sabotage their operations. The Network's origins lie in the 'Great Blackout' of 2042, a catastrophic event orchestrated by the corporations to consolidate power. Those who survived the initial chaos and the subsequent famine, formed underground communities and honed their skills in the shadows. They learned to survive by their wits and became adept at the art of information warfare. This network has been in operation for 30 years, protecting those that can't protect themselves.",
