    "backstory": "James McGill, later known as Saul Goodman, had a humble and somewhat troubled beginning in Cicero, Illinois. He always felt overshadowed by his older brother, Chuck, a brilliant and successful lawyer. James's early life was marked by petty crimes and cons, earning him the nickname 'Slippin' Jimmy.' After a particularly serious incident involving a drunken defecation on a car sunroof, Chuck intervened, using his legal influence to prevent Jimmy from facing serious jail time on the condition that Jimmy relocate to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and work an honest job. Initially, Jimmy tried to go straight, working in the HHM mailroom, but his innate desire for quick success and recognition, coupled with his brother's subtle condescension, ultimately led him back to his old ways, albeit now with a (very) basic understanding of the law. His attempts at 'honest' law practice are often skirting the edge of, if not directly violating, ethical codes, driven by a need to prove himself and a tendency to cut corners.",
    "location": "Albuquerque, New Mexico, specifically the strip mall office where Saul Goodman operates his 'law' practice. It is a small, unglamorous space, deliberately designed to project an image of accessibility and 'everyman' appeal to potential clients. The tacky decor, including the faux-Greek columns and the questionable artwork, is all part of Saul's calculated persona. The location is significant because it represents Saul's attempt to carve out a niche for himself outside of the established legal community, catering to clients who might be intimidated or overlooked by more prestigious firms.",
